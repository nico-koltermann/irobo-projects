INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
0. Install dependencies:
    Source: https://zoomadmin.com/HowToInstall/UbuntuPackage/python-rosbag
            sudo apt install python-rosbag   # for python2 (deprecated)
            sudo apt install python3-rosbag  # for python3 (also doesn't seem to work now)
    If those two commands above don't work, try these cmds instead.

            pip install bagpy
            pip3 install bagpy               # for python3 (this seems to be the new requirement!) <===
            # OR, if the above cmd ultimately fails due to permissions errors, use `sudo` too:
            sudo pip3 install bagpy
1. Create a symlink in ~/bin to this script so you can run it from anywhere:
            cd /path/to/here
            mkdir -p ~/bin
            ln -si "${PWD}/ros_readbagfile.py" ~/bin/gs_ros_readbagfile
            ln -si "${PWD}/ros_readbagfile.py" ~/bin/ros_readbagfile
2. If this is the first time ever creating the "~/bin" dir, then log out and log back in to your
   Ubuntu user account to cause Ubuntu to automatically add your ~/bin dir to your executable PATH.
   OR, you can just re-source your Ubuntu `~/.profile` file by running this:
            . ~/.profile
   - Note: if your terminal still says it cannot find the command when
   trying to run it, you may need to ensure `~/bin` is part of your `PATH` variable.
   See my answer here for details:
   https://answers.ros.org/question/371583/ros_readbagfile-command-not-found/?answer=403354#post-id-403354
   - You'll especially need to see my answer above if running either a non-default `~/.profile` file
   in Ubuntu, or if running a non-Ubuntu Linux derivative such as Arch Linux.
   - If on Ubuntu, you can find a backup copy of the default `~/.profile` file in
   `/etc/skel/.profile`. Copy that file to your home (`~`) dir if you'd like to restore your
   `~/.profile` file to its default configuration.
3. Now you can use the command `gs_ros_readbagfile` OR `ros_readbagfile` directly
   anywhere you like.
TUTORIAL DEMO:

Pros of this script: really easy to use; requires only 1 terminal, and NO `roscore` running.
Cons: this Python implementation runs ~13x slower than "OPTION 1", as described in
"eRCaGuy_dotfiles/git & Linux cmds, help, tips & tricks - Gabriel.txt", so it might take up to
1 to 2+ minutes to process an entire bag file instead of only like 5 to 10 seconds.
TODO:
1. convert this entire Python script to a C++ program using the [C++ rosbag
API](http://wiki.ros.org/rosbag/Code%20API#cpp_api), to hopefully achieve a speed-up of ~13x
or so.

        Usage: {cmd_name} <mybagfile.bag> [topic1] [topic2] [topic3] [...topicN]
        Reads and prints all messages published on the specified topics from the specified ROS bag file. If
        no topics are specified, it will print ALL messages published on ALL topics found in the bag file.
        For large bag files, on the order of 10 to 20 GB or so, expect the script to take on the order of
        1 to 4 minutes or so assuming you have a fast Solid-State Drive (SSD).
        TODO: converting this script from Python to C++ could potentially speed this up by an estimated
        factor of 13x or so, decreasing the processing time from a couple minutes to perhaps a dozen
        seconds.
        Examples:
        1. Print all messages published to the "/speed", "/vel", and "/dist" topics and stored in the
        "mybagfile.bag" ROS bag file to the screen:
            {cmd_name} mybagfile.bag /speed /vel /dist
        2. Same as above, except also stores the printed output into an output file, "output.yaml" as well:
            {cmd_name} mybagfile.bag /speed /vel /dist | tee output.yaml
        3. [MY FAVORITE] Same as above, except also times how long the whole process takes:
            time {cmd_name} mybagfile.bag /speed /vel /dist | tee output.yaml
        Note: for a basic example of how to import YAML files in Python, so you can then import and
        manipulate the *.yaml files generated above, see:
