# IRobo - Projects

This repository contains the tasks from the "Introduction to robotics" course of the Instituto Sueprieor TÃ©cnico Lisboa. 
The goal is to learn fundamentals of robotics, while using ROS.

In this repository multiple approaches are implemented for localization, planning and controls.

__The final report can be read here: [Report](./docs/iRobo_Report.pdf)__

## Using the repository

This projects uses the [turtlebot3](https://www.turtlebot.com/turtlebot3/) platform. 


## Localization

```turtlebot3_scan_to_map```

In the scenario, the map is known and the robot receives a 2D LiDAR scan. 
A scan matching algorithm is implemented for korrekting the given EKF algrithm.

## Planning

```turtlebot3_send_nav_goals```

A node, which takes the GridMap and calculate random points as goal points for the 
control algorithm

```turtlebot3_markov_decision```

With a Markiv-Decision model a path is planned throught a known map with obstacles. 
We can self define rules for this algorithm to avoid regions and paths in that map.

## Utils

```turtlebot3_cmd_smoother```

Some pass-filter like smoothing for the control command on the real robot. This increased performance and accuracy

```turtlebot3_viz```

Visualization for EKF and PCL ground truth data.

```turtlebot3_custom```

Custom maps for more references in out data set for all algorithms

## Evaluation

In the evaluation, a scipt is used for extracting data from a ROS bag to write it into 
a json file.

This can then by visualized with matplotlib:
